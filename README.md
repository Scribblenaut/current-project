Stuff I'm doing right now

1. My main obligation is working on pictocons. I'm reorganizing my xml file(again) into several smaller ones that my code can loop through.
2. For my file sharing site I'm finally convinced backgroundworkers in asp.net will require more dangerous hackery(I'm not gonna mess with the threads) than I want to get into. Therefore i'm writing it in python.
